        Your first step in how to start planning a trip is to choose a travel
        destination that meets your interests and travel budget.Are you planning
        overseas travel or a domestic trip at home? Either way, the whole idea
        of taking a trip is to have a memorable time, to have fun and relax, and
        not to spend your whole vacation time worrying about money.If you only
        have 1-2 weeks of vacation time per year, don’t waste too much of that
        time traveling to and from your destination. Plan your trip
        accordingly.But if you have 2-4 weeks or over a month you can look at
        taking an overseas trip or traveling further within your home country.

        Once you have chosen your destination, step two in planning a trip is to
        book your flights. And learning how to find cheap flights will help you
        to reduce one of your biggest travel expenses. As a traveling family, if
        it’s an overseas trip and a long haul flight I like to plan my trip so
        we get to our destination as quickly as possible, with the most amount
        of comfort and facilities our budget allows! If it’s your one-and-only
        dream vacation for the year, and you only have 1-2 weeks, I recommend
        you pay the little bit extra for a premium airline and fly direct too!

        Another thing to consider when planning a trip is to find out the
        transportation options in your chosen destination. Will you need to book
        a rental car or pre-purchase any transportation passes online? Is there
        a train or bus service? Are there taxis or Uber? Can you simply walk to
        most places?

        When you plan a trip you’ll want to know what are the must-visit tourist
        attractions and the best free things to do in your chosen destination.
        As much as we like to just show up, some trip planning is a good idea
        especially if you are visiting a popular destination in the peak travel
        season.
